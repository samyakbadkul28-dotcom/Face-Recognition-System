# üß† Face Recognition System using Python & OpenCV

A complete beginner-friendly **Face Recognition Project** built using **Python, OpenCV, and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram)** algorithm.  
This project captures faces, trains a recognizer model, and performs **real-time face detection and recognition** through a webcam.

## üì∏ Project Overview

This project teaches you how to build a **Face Recognition System** from scratch using Python and OpenCV.  
It consists of three main steps:

1. **Face Capture** ‚Äì Capture multiple images of each user using your webcam.  
2. **Training** ‚Äì Train an LBPH model on the captured images.  
3. **Real-Time Recognition** ‚Äì Recognize faces in real-time using the trained model.
